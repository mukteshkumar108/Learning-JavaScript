This repository contains my daily JavaScript practice code.

The purpose of this repo is to:

* Build consistency through daily commits
* Practice JavaScript fundamentals and core concepts
* Learn by writing, testing, and refining small pieces of code
* Track progress over time

I believe in learning in public and improving through iteration.

I will become top 1% javascript developer 🔥🔥🔥
